The Odin Project

First Javascript Project

Updated with a basic UI.

Followed the tutorial found @https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWPtKtYEsN4

Expanded on my own with:
1. game restart + helper funcitons
2. interactive buttons
3. result screen

Future plans:
1. Make mobile-friendly, responsive
2. Improve CSS (better transitions)
3. multiplayer networking w/ sockets (socket.io library)
4. sounds?
5. Add explosion effect on round winner

bugs:
1. selected choice needs more css
2. button top border is unclickable
3. Result Transition too slow
